  This is an exercise for learning about interpreters, compilers, and
  how to turn interpreters into compilers. I'm following the
  incredibly fun tutorial from https://github.com/darius/toot! Thank
  you so much!!!

  Since I really only learn by repetition, I have to do one thing a
  few times before I fully grasp it. But I do need some variation to
  not get bored to death while repeating myself. That's why I'm
  implementing these exercises in different languages.
